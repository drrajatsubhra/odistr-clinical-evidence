# ODISTR – On Demand INTRANASAL STEROID THERAPY of Rajatsubhra

**ODISTR** (On Demand INTRANASAL STEROID THERAPY of Rajatsubhra) is a novel pediatric treatment approach developed by **Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay** for managing allergic airway diseases, including WALRI (Wheezy Allergic Lower Respiratory Illness), pediatric asthma, and chronic allergic rhinitis.

This method emphasizes **episodic, timely, and minimal** usage of intranasal steroids (INS) to control allergic inflammation in the upper airway, indirectly improving lower respiratory outcomes. ODISTR was clinically applied and refined through years of outpatient evidence-based treatment at *Child Health Care Arambag*, West Bengal, India.

The method offers a **non-invasive, low-dose, guardian-managed** model that empowers families and reduces the need for long-term systemic medication or hospitalization in many allergic children.
